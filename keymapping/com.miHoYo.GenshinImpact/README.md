## Genshin Impact keymapping
A keymap made by PianothShaveck#5009.

I took some of the ideas I've seen above and I combined them with my ideas, here's my Genshin Impact keymapping that I've made with this features, to get as close as possible to the PC version:
- You can sprint both with shift and with right mouse button, like in the PC version
- You can cancel climbing with X, like in the PC version
- There's a second joystick, fully working with arrow keys, for the teapot
- You can take items with F, like in the PC version. If there are 2 items, you can take the upper item with G, and the lower item with F
- You can unfreeze by spamming H
- You can aim with bow characters by pressing R, like in the PC version
- You can press T to move easily with Electrograna, like in the PC version
- If there are 5 characters in the team, you can choose the last character with "4"
- You can quickly change the party setup by pressing Esc followed by L
- You can press the middle mouse button to activate Elemental Sight, like in the PC version, except you can't hold it while running because unfortunately, the mobile version doesn't work that way

I think it's honestly hardly improvable. The only thing I didn't put is "G" for when there's new tutorial, because I'd rather keep it for a second item, but I think you can live without it (or you can move the G up there if you really, really want).
