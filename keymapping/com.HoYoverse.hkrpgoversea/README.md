# Honkai: Star Rail

## PianothShaveck's keymap
**Aspect Ratio: 16:9**

### Outside of battle:
- WASD to move
- Use mouse to look around like you'd do in Genshin
- F to pickup/interact. I made F bigger on purpose, because I've noticed that sometimes the interact button is slightly higher or slightly lower, so I don't recommend changing its position
- 1234 to switch between characters
- Left shift OR Right mouse button to run while moving
- Left mouse button to ATK (to destroy objects/start battle)
- Space to use Technique points
- K to open unread messages near the map (if there are any)
- J to open missions
- V to see current mission
- G to open tutorial
- Esc to pause menu
- M to map
- C to character screen
- B to inventory
- L to team selection screen
- F1 to open menu with Survival Index/Daily Training
- F3 to open Warp (gacha system)
- F4 to open Nameless Honor (battle pass)
- F5 to open Travel Log (current events menu)
- U to see active status effect, if present
- X opens camera when needed in some daily missions

### In battle:
You can technically do everything with mouse, but I added keymapping so the mouse is only needed to choose the enemy to attack (you do not need to press alt to select enemy, just move the mouse left/right towards the enemy you want to attack)
- Q / E to switch between basic ATK and skill. You can also press the left mouse button to use the basic ATK. If you hold Q or E, you'll also be able to read a description. I've placed Q / E precisely, so this position also works for characters with 2 different ULT (the main character). For characters with only 1 ULT, you can press either Q or E.
- 7 8 9 0 to use any ULT that are ready among the 4 characters you have.

- Right Thumbstick: Screen
- Button X: Interact with NPCs or entities
- Direction Pad: Choose charactors
- Right Shoulder: Sprint
- Left Shoulder: Gadgets (Treasure map/stuff finder)
- Right Trigger: Technique

### In battle:
- Button B: Normal Attack/Normal Ultimate
- Right Trigger: Skill/Ranged Ultimate

### Notes
- Attack targets have to be selected by mouse. Ultimates have to be fired by mouse.
- DO NOT TOUCH LEFT THUMBSTICK DURING A BATTLE, otherwise the Ultimate of the first charactor may be accidently used.
